                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, mostly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobos and chimpanzees.</p>
                    <p>They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years in the wild.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas are considered highly intelligent. A few individuals in captivity, such as Koko, have been taught a subset of sign language. Like the other great apes, gorillas can laugh, grieve, have "rich emotional lives", develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and think about the past and future.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the gorillas next to the baboons.</p>
